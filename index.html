        Web technologies form the backbone of modern internet applications. They enable the display, styling and interaction of documents in browsers and on many devices.
        Learning HTML provides the structure, CSS offers presentation, and JavaScript adds interactivity. Together these technologies allow developers to build responsive and accessible websites.
        This site demonstrates a small multi-page example using only HTML and one external CSS file shared across pages.
        The examples and links below point to reference sources and related reading.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML provides the structure of web pages using elements and attributes. It defines headings, paragraphs, forms, tables and links which are interpreted by browsers.</p>
        <p>Proper semantic HTML improves accessibility and search engine understanding. Use headings in logical order and mark up lists, tables and forms appropriately.</p>
        <p>Modern HTML5 includes media elements and APIs for better integration with browser features and devices.</p>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS controls the visual presentation of HTML documents, including layout, color, spacing and responsive behavior. It separates content from presentation.</p>
        <p>Using a single external stylesheet across pages improves maintainability and ensures consistent look and feel for a site.</p>
        <p>Flexbox and Grid are common techniques for building responsive column layouts that adapt to screen size.</p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>Good resources include MDN Web Docs, W3C specifications and community tutorials. Official docs explain standards and browser support.</p>
        <p>Practicing by building pages and inspecting with browser developer tools accelerates learning. Experimentation helps understand layout, box model and media queries.</p>
        <p>Keep accessibility and performance in mind: use alt text, semantic markup and optimize assets.</p>
